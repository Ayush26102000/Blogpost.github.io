            <h3>Who are the taliban?</h3>
            <p>The Taliban which refers to itself as the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan is a Deobandi Islamist movement and military organization in Afghanistan, currently waging war within the country. Since 2016, the Taliban's leader has been Mawlawi Hibatullah
                Akhundzada.In 2021, the Taliban was estimated to have 200,000 fighters. </p><br>
            <p> From 1996 to 2001, the Taliban held power over roughly three-quarters of Afghanistan, and enforced a strict interpretation of Sharia, or Islamic law. The Taliban emerged in 1994 as one of the prominent factions in the Afghan Civil War and
                largely consisted of students (talib) from the Pashtun areas of eastern and southern Afghanistan who had been educated in traditional Islamic schools, and fought during the Soviet–Afghan War. Under the leadership of Mohammed Omar, the
                movement spread throughout most of Afghanistan, sequestering power from the Mujahideen warlords. </p>

            <h3>Afghanistan: Why is there a war?</h3>
            <p>After 20 years of war, foreign forces are pulling out of Afghanistan following a deal between the US and the Taliban militants they removed from power back in 2001. The conflict has killed tens of thousands of people and displaced millions.
                The Taliban have pledged not to allow Afghanistan to become a base for terrorists who could threaten the West. But the country's hardline former rulers have quickly gained territory in recent weeks from Afghan army soldiers, who are now
                being left to protect a fragile government. The Taliban also made a pledge for national peace talks, but many fear a worsening civil war remains a far more likely outcome. Nevertheless, Joe Biden, the fourth US president to oversee what
                has become America's longest-ever war - one costing hundreds of billions of dollars - has set a symbolic date of 11 September 2021 for full withdrawal.</p>

            <h3>How costly has the war been?</h3>
            <p>In terms of lives lost, it is obviously not easy to say exactly. The number of coalition casualties is much better recorded than Taliban and Afghan civilians. Research by Brown University estimates losses in the Afghan security forces at 69,000.
                It puts the number of civilians and militants killed at about 51,000 each.More than 3,500 coalition soldiers have died since 2001 - about two-thirds of them Americans. More than 20,000 US soldiers have been injured. According to the UN,
                Afghanistan has the third-largest displaced population in the world. Since 2012, some five million people have fled and not been able to return home, either displaced within Afghanistan or taking refuge in neighbouring countries. Brown
                University research also puts the US spending on the conflict - including military and reconstruction funds in both Afghanistan and Pakistan - at $978bn (£706bn) up to 2020.</p>

            <h3>Can the Taliban Be Stopped? Three Scenarios for What’s Next in Afghanistan</h3>
            <p>The Afghan government has had its most difficult week fighting the Taliban since the insurgency began. As of this writing, 12 provincial capitals have fallen since last Friday, marking the first time the Taliban have controlled a city since
                they were ousted in 2001. By some estimates the Taliban control two-thirds of the country. While many experts predicted that the rapid and unconditional withdrawal of U.S. troops would increase Taliban control, few saw it happening this
                fast. A Taliban takeover of Kabul — once thought to be years away if at all — is now conceivable within months, or even a matter of weeks.While Afghan government forces struggle to slow Taliban momentum, Afghan civilians are suffering
                most. Civilian casualties have soared during the most recent Taliban offensives and there are reports of widespread Taliban atrocities, signaling a return to the darkest times of the militant group’s rule. Recent reports of summary executions
                of captured Afghan soldiers, beating women who are considered to be immodestly dressed, forced marriages, and assassinations of civil society leaders and journalists have created a sense of panic among the population and led to a massive
                crisis of internal displacement.</p>
